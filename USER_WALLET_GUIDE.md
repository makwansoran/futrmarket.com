This guide explains how users can view their wallet address and withdraw funds on the FuturBet website.

## Viewing Your Wallet Address

### Method 1: Account Page (Recommended)

1. **Log in** to your account
2. **Navigate to Account** page (click your email in the header → Account)
3. **Scroll to "Your Deposit Wallet" section**
4. You'll see:
   - Your deposit address (copyable)
   - QR code for easy scanning
   - Instructions on how to deposit
   - Your current balance

### Method 2: Deposit Button

1. Click the **Deposit** button in the header
2. Your deposit address and QR code are shown in the modal

## Withdrawing Funds to Your Personal Wallet

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Go to Account Page** or click **Withdraw** button in header
2. **Click "Withdraw" button** (in Account page or header)
3. **Enter your personal wallet address** (where you want to receive funds)
4. **Select asset** (USDC or ETH)
5. **Enter amount** (minimum $10 USD)
6. **Click "Withdraw Funds"**
7. **Wait for transaction** - funds will be sent from our custodial wallet to your address

### Withdrawal Details

- **Minimum withdrawal**: $10 USD
- **Supported assets**: USDC or ETH
- **Processing time**: Usually a few minutes (depends on network congestion)
- **Transaction fee**: Gas fees are paid by the platform (not deducted from your balance)

### Viewing Withdrawal History

- Recent withdrawals are shown in the withdrawal modal
- Each withdrawal shows:
  - Asset type
  - Amount in USD
  - Destination address
  - Transaction hash (click to view on Etherscan)
  - Date and time

## How It Works

### Deposits
1. You send USDC or ETH to your custodial wallet address
2. Platform scans for deposits and credits your account balance
3. Funds appear in your account balance (1:1 for USDC, current price for ETH)

### Withdrawals
1. You request withdrawal with your personal wallet address
2. Platform sends funds from your custodial wallet to your personal wallet
3. Your account balance is deducted
4. Transaction is recorded and visible in history

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security**:
- Your custodial wallet address is deterministic (same email = same address)
- Private keys are stored securely server-side
- Never share your private keys

⚠️ **Fees**:
- Minimum deposit: $10 USD (excluding gas fees)
- Minimum withdrawal: $10 USD
- Gas fees for withdrawals are paid by the platform

⚠️ **Processing**:
- Deposits: Scan for deposits using the "Check" button
- Withdrawals: Usually process within a few minutes
- Check transaction status on Etherscan using the transaction hash

## Troubleshooting

### Can't see my wallet address
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check Account page
- Refresh the page

### Withdrawal failed
- Check you have sufficient balance
- Verify wallet address is correct (0x... format)
- Ensure minimum withdrawal is $10
- Check if custodial wallet has enough funds (contact support if needed)

### Transaction pending
